Infolab:[Python Visualisations]

A compilation of purpose-based matplotlib plots most useful in data analysis and visualization. This list provides a real choice as to which visualization to use for what situation, using python’s matplotlib and seaborn library.

The charts are grouped based by purpose, with the most popular visualizations displayed. For example, if you want to picturize the relationship between 2 variables, check out the plots under the ‘Correlation’ section. Or if you want to show how a value changed over time, look under the ‘Change’ section and so on.

NOTE. An effective chart is one which:

  1. Conveys the right and necessary information without distorting facts.
  2. Simple in design, you dont have to strain in order to get it.
  3. Aesthetics support the information rather than overshadow it. 
  4. Not overloaded with information.

Prerequisites
    1. Python installed |(latest version 3.+)
    2. Anaconda installed |(lastest version)

Getting Started

There are two options you can use to run this code, rather than just view within Jupyter NBviewer (links below)

<links>

Option 1 - Access the jupyter notebooks from the \\finbilab02\landing\ location. With Python and Anaconda installed on the server, you will be able to access the Jupyter notebooks stored within this (DACommunityofPractice) GitHub repository. You will need use the 'Anaconda command line prompt' in order to get access the notebooks as follows:

<command line image)

Once the command line statement has run you will be able to view the following 'http://localhost:8888/tree' page, listing the files available to you to use.

Click on the file of your choice to run.

Option 2 - Access the jupyter notebooks from your own machine. In order to do this you will have needed to have had Python and Anaconda installed on your machine. As before, you would then be able to able to access the Jupyter notebooks stored within this (DACommunityofPractice) GitHub repository. Again, the 'Anaconda command line prompt' will need used to access the notebooks.

If you are not able to run these notebooks, but would still like to view and or copy the code, access the server using the Windows Explorer location: '\\finbilab\landing\'. Right click on the notebook you are interested in, having first viewed the content useing the NBviewer links displayed above. Use the 'open with' option to open the notebook in notepad.
